### Usage
input .hic file  (low resolution)

output  .npy file at chromosome level (both inter- and intra-) (enhanced resolution)


```
python strawHiCplus.py

```

### Requirements
install HiCplus

install straw

### Attention

The code now is hard coded. Need to manually change the input and chromosome numbers.
